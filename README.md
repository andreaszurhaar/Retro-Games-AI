# Retro-Games-AI
AI that can learn how to play any game in the gym-retro library. 

Using the NEAT neural network training, this code allows you to train to learn how to play any game in the gym-retro library. All that is needed is a rom of the game, and that you modify the code to put in the name of the game, as well as the level you want to play. There is also a feature that you can turn on or off that allows you get a video saved every time the AI reaches a new highest fitness score. This allows you to turn of rendering while still being able to see the highlights.
